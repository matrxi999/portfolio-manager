This project allowed me to develop my object-oriented programming skills in Python, and also allowed me to learn about the Tkinter library for creating GUIs and how to web scrape data from websites.

I also implemented the ability to import and export typed data to a file using the pickle library.

The data about the valuation of companies on the market and the current exchange rates are taken from "yahoo finance" and "x-rates currency" websites respectively using beautifulsoup library.
